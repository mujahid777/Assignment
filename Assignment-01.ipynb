    "Q.14- How is memory manaded in Python?\n",
    "Ans-  Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all \n",
    "      Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap \n",
    "      is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The Python memory \n",
    "      manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage\n",
    "      management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching. \n",

    "Ans-  Installing Python on Windows-\n",
    "         \n",
    "    The installation process for Python on Windows is simple, with only a couple of \n",
    "    extra steps that we have to follow. These steps enable us to access Python from \n",
    "    anywhere on our system and install software using its built-in package manager. \n",
    "    Installing Python in this manner enables the creation of projects that work with\n",
    "    the operating system, for example notifications and automated system tasks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Open a browser to the Python website and download the Windows installer.\n",
    "    2.Double click on the downloaded file and install Python for all users, and ensure \n",
    "      that Python is added to your path. Click on Install now to begin.\n",
    "    3.After the installation is complete, click Disable path length limit and then Close.\n",
    "    4.Click Close to end the installation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Path variable-\n",
    "    \n",
    "       The PATH variable is a list of directories where each directory contains the\n",
    "       executable file for a command.\n",
    "\n",
    "       When a command is entered into the Windows command prompt, the prompt searches in \n",
    "    the PATH variable for an executable file with the same name as the command; in the \n",
    "    case that the required file is not found, it responds with an error message that states \n",
    "    that the specified command was not recognized.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    One way to overcome this error is to write the complete directory of the executable file \n",
    "    instead of only entering the command name. However, this is not a very user-friendly approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another possible, and easier, way to avoid this error is to add the executable file’s directory \n",
    "    to the PATH variable. Oftentimes, this needs to be done when installing Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
