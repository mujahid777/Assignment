    "### Q.1> Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GET:** The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. When a user types a URL into a web browser, \n",
    "the browser sends a GET request to the server asking for the resource at that URL. The parameters for the \n",
    "request (such as search queries or page number) are included in the URL itself, separated by a question mark. \n",
    "Because the parameters are included in the URL, GET requests are visible to the user and can be bookmarked or \n",
    "shared. GET requests are also cached by browsers, which can speed up page load times for frequently visited pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**POST:** The POST method is used to send data to a server. For example, when a user fills out a form on a website \n",
    "and clicks \"Submit,\" the data from the form is sent to the server using a POST request. Unlike GET requests, \n",
    "POST requests do not include parameters in the URL. Instead, they include the parameters in the request body, \n",
    "which is not visible to the user. This makes POST requests more secure for transmitting sensitive information \n",
    "such as passwords or credit card numbers. Because POST requests are not cached, they are slower than GET requests \n",
    "for repeated requests of the same data."
