    "# Ans:  The process by which data and functions are defined in such a way that only essential\n",
    "#       details can be seen and unnecessary implementations are hidden is called Abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Abstraction is really powerful for making complex tasks and codes simpler when used in Object-Oriented\n",
    "#   Programming. It reduces the complexity for the user by making the relevant part accessible and usable\n",
    "#   leaving the unnecessary code hidden. Also, there are times when we do not want to give out sensitive\n",
    "#   parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction can also prove to be very functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   From a programmer’s perspective, if we think about data abstraction, there is more to it than just hiding\n",
    "#   unnecessary information. One other way to think of abstraction is as synonymous with generalization. If, for\n",
    "#   instance, you wanted to create a program to multiply eight times seven, you wouldn't build an application to\n",
    "#   only multiply those two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Instead, you'd create a program capable of multiplying any two numbers. To put it another way, abstraction \n",
    "#   is a way of thinking about a function's specific use as separate from its more generalized purpose. Thinking\n",
    "#   this way lets you create flexible, scalable, and adaptable functions and programs.\n",

    "#   Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes and inheriting them later.\n",

    "\n",
    "#   Definition : Abstraction is hiding the details and implementation of the code. Encapsulation is hiding the \n",
    "#   data and controlling the visibility of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Phase : Abstraction is a design level process. Encapsulation is an implementation level process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Pivotal Ability : Abstraction is concerned about what a class instance can do, instead of the implementation \n",
    "#   of the class. Encapsulation helps in data binding and control over maintaining the transparency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Use Case : Abstraction is a design level process and it is used to reduce the complexity at the designing stage\n",
    "#   of a project. Encapsulation is an implementation level process, and it is used to provide privacy and maintain \n",
    "#   control over the transparency of data at the implementation stage of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   How to Implement : Abstraction can be achieved using Abstract classes in Python. Encapsulation is also implemented\n",
    "#   using classes and the control over data privacy by making attributes and methods public,protected or private.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Focus: The prominent difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction lies in the focus. Abstraction mainly focuses \n",
    "#   on what must be done, whereas encapsulation mainly focuses on how it must be done. Understanding this difference \n",
    "#   between Abstraction and Encapsulation in Python helps you to design solutions faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   You can better understand Encapsulation vs Abstraction with an example. Abstraction is used in mobile phones’ GUI.\n",
    "#   When you click on the icons, abstraction allows them to perform specific functions. Let’s look at the encapsulation\n",
    "#   example to clarify the Encapsulation vs Abstraction. After the icon is clicked, the encapsulation works in the \n",
    "#   backend to guide the user on the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Data representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   One significant difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation in Python is how they represent data. Abstraction \n",
    "#   represents only useful data, whereas encapsulation wraps data and codes for necessary information. Moreover, it \n",
    "#   helps developers to easily organize the whole code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Abstraction provides you with a more abstract overview and thus hides the complexity. Encapsulation hides the internal\n",
    "#   working, which helps you to change it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Program partition:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Another key difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation in Python is the way programs are partitioned.\n",
    "#   Abstraction can partition the program into several distinct fragments whereas Encapsulation can be easily adapted \n",
    "#   to the new requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Problem-solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Abstraction solves problems at the design level whereas Encapsulation does at the implementation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   How Abstraction and Encapsulation can solve real-world problems?\n",

    "#   The differences between Abstraction vs Encapsulation in Python are not just limited to the above points.\n",
    "#   You also need to understand how they solve real-world problems to accurately comprehend the difference\n",
    "#   between Abstraction and Encapsulation in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   A real-world example of Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Firstly, we take an example of a banking application to understand Encapsulation vs Abstraction. Suppose you want\n",
    "#   to develop a banking application and are asked to gather all the details of your customer. You may gather some details\n",
    "#   that are irrelevant when developing a banking application. Hence, you have to choose only valuable information like\n",
    "#   name, address, tax info, etc. The process of fetching, removing, and selecting the customer information from a pool\n",
    "#   of data is called Abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   The information, once extracted, can be utilized for various applications. For example, you can use the same data for \n",
    "#   job portal applications, hospital applications, a Government database, etc. with slight or no amendment. Therefore, \n",
    "#   it works as your Master Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   A real-world example of Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   Let’s take an example of mobile devices to clarify the Abstraction vs Encapsulation in Python. Using smartphones, you \n",
    "#   can perform tasks like capturing photos, recording audio/video, listening to music, accessing the web, etc. These features\n",
    "#   are common in all smartphones. You don’t have to understand the internal working of these features. For example, you don’t\n",
