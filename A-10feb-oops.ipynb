    "#         The close() function is used to close an open file in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   It's important to close a file in Python for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "#   1)Releasing resources: When you open a file, your system reserves resources, such as memory, for that file. Closing the file frees up those resources for other tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "#     system when the file is closed. If you don't close a file properly, the data in the buffer may not be written to the file, leading to data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   3)Avoiding file lock issues: When you open a file, it's locked for use by the current process. If you don't close the file, other processes may not be able to access it,\n",
    "#     leading to file lock issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#   4)Proper file management: Properly closing files helps ensure that the file system remains in a consistent state. If you don't close a file, the file may remain open, even \n",
